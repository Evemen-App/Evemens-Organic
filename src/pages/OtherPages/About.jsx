          Welcome to <span className="font-semibold italic">Eve</span>mens where nature meets nourishment.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg mb-4">
          Born from a passion for purity and wellness, our mission is simple: to celebrate the beauty of African shea butter in its most authentic form.
          Sourced ethically from trusted womenâ€™s cooperatives across West Africa, our products are handcrafted with love, care, and tradition.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg mb-4">
          At Evemens we believe in the power of nature to heal, protect, and glow. Our shea butter is 100% organic, unrefined, and packed with vitamins that deeply moisturize, soothe, and rejuvenate your skin and hair.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg mb-4">
          We are more than just skincareâ€”we are a movement that honors culture, empowers communities, and promotes clean beauty for all.
        </p>
